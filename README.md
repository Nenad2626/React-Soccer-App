# React-Soccer-App
Greetings.This is an app made in React with json file.Bootstrap is been used also.If you wanna use this app first thing first you have to install Node js.After install necessary tools and create react app in your folder.It would be great if you use Visual Studio Code or Webstorm as your IDE editor.After you finish all of that run your server with npm start in your terminal.Localhost 3000 should appear.It is highly important to have index.html,index.css,index.js,App.css,App.js,serviceWorker.js,settings.js.Without that you cannot run this app.If you don't have you can include Bootstrap in index.html file
